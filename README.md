# Moshify

This is a marketing website for a fake company. This site is a responsive website with semantic HTML. Animations for the site were made with AOS (Animation On Scroll). The site is bundled with Parcel and deployed with Netlify. The HTML and CSS were validated with W3C Validation Service. Cloudconvert was used to convert my images to webp. CSS custom properties were used to help style the page. Seperation of concerns for components in CSS were written for skins and structure. This allowed for more easily changing the look of a button. The desktop and mobile sites were built following designs from Adobe Photoshop.
